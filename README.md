2. DATA DESCRIPTION

After searching online for relevant datasets, I found the “Human Resources
Analytics” hosted on Kaggle to be an ideal choice. The dataset had the
scope of analyzing why employees leave prematurely, and several models
could be used which can enhance my understanding of the algorithms.

 The dataset has 10 variables and 14,999 observations.
 It consists of 8 numeric variables and 2 factor variables.

Fields in the dataset include:
 Last evaluation
 Number of projects
 Average monthly hours
 Time spent at the company
 Whether they have had a work accident
 Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
 Department
 Salary
 Whether the employee has left

The variables ‘Sales’& ‘Salary’ are factor variables, while the rest were
numeric variables.

3. ANALYSIS

The dataset does not have any missing values, and thus not require any imputation.
